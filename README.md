## 🔧 Tools Used
- Burp Suite
- SQLMap
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)

## 🎯 Objective
Simulate and exploit SQL Injection vulnerability in a web application using both manual and automated tools.

## 🛠 Steps Performed
1. Set up DVWA on localhost via XAMPP.
2. Logged into DVWA and set security level to low.
3. Used Burp Suite to intercept vulnerable login request.
4. Used SQLMap to automate data extraction from the backend.

## 🧐 What I Learned
- Difference between manual and automated SQLi
- How SQL injection can reveal database contents
- Importance of input validation and prepared statements
